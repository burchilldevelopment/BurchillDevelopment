## Purpose
I designed this web application to be a personal developer website for myself and to display my new React skills. 
## React Application
This web application was created using the create-react-app template for the React JavaScript library by Facebook. This is my first attempt at creating my own React app after approximately one week of learning important React concepts. The React source code is located under the master branch.
